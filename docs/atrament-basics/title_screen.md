# Title screen

The title screen of the game displays game title, author's name, and cover image.

It is defined by the following global tags:

```
# title: Game Title
# author: Author's name
# cover: images/game_cover.jpg
```

You can change the order of these items, or remove them completely, with `#title_screen_layout` global tag:

```
# title_screen_layout: cover, title, author
```
