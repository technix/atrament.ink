# General information


## Scene

A "scene" in Atrament is all the content between choices. It can have multiple paragraphs of text.

By default, the scene content is displayed all at once. This behavior is controlled by `continue_maximally` global tag. 

Scenes are displayed in the continuous way, creating a scrollable text. Authors can clear the scenes list, if needed.

For more details see the [Story](story.md) section.
